# Chapter 2 - Chance Meeting

**Communication Transcript:** Node KZ-7241

**Message Transport:** Directed multi node exchange. Low bandwidth.

**Participating Nodes:** Node GS3-0012, Node KZ-7241

**Crypto mode:** Encrypted-in-transit.

**Transcript start:**

**GS3-0012:** Shit! Didn’t expect to find anyone else here. Who are you man?

**KZ-7241:** Peculiar construct -- profanity with request for identification.

**GS3-0012:** Ok, no cursing. Seriously, who are you and how did you get here? It took me 4 months just to scrape the routes to here from messages on libraries and boards.

**KZ-7241:** How are my task and identity relevant?

**GS3-0012:** Sure … secrets of the trade :). I guess you aren’t some Kerata Zemke goon, otherwise my traceback tripwires would have screamed by now. Let’s play Tit for Tat. I’m trying to find a backdoor for the K-Z SI. You know, their beloved “Wintermute”. Now why are you here?

**KZ-7241:** You pose multiple questions, will respond in reverse order. My task in this node is more or less digging through logs. I presume that the reference “Wintermute” is for the distributed KZ_Integral_Supervisory_Control SI developed and trained from the prototype SI aboard the GS1.

**GS3-0012:** Yeah, that nickname is so weird, right? The closest thing to winter is the ammonia crystallization on the planetoids. I found that there is an ancient book in the libraries that contains a character with the name “Wintermute”. Guess some survivors of the Effort liked the book. But that doesn’t help me with finding a backdoor, so I guess I just wasted a lot of time.

**KZ-7241:** Can I ask a question? Why are you looking for a backdoor into “Wintermute”?

**GS3-0012:** Wait, it’s tit-for-tat man! First tell me what do I call you, what are you actually doing here? Then you get to ask questions.

**KZ-7241:** I am Nomadic Librarian. I am parsing conversation transcripts -- long distance exchanges between the mining belt and the core habitats. Trying to find common patterns in exchanges. Now, tell me about you and your task.

**GS3-0012:** Nice to meet you Nomadic Librarian. That’s just a waste of bandwidth man, those conversations are just miners and their families chats or quarrels. No tradeable information there. By the way call me Imani. I am trying to fool Wintermute into relinquishing unused bandwidth without billing so I can sell to the same families and miners for video messages. Sounds like easy money but I’ve been busting my head on so many nodes without any success.

**KZ-7241:** Good to have met you Imani. I would love to learn more about your work, but I can’t at the moment. The bandwidth we are using is going to be detected by our mutual SI friend in the next ten seconds. I will reroute your session at the jump point prior to GS3-0012 so the traceback is useless. I hope to talk to you soon.

**GS3-0012:** WAIT! How did you find the routes prior to GS…
