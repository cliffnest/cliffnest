Welcome back from hibernation. This document is a quick historical refresh of your orientation and onboarding into everyday life.

It is well understood that this system had an official designation that you know at launch, but due to reasons explained in this document the system is now called My Way.

Basic information of the star system: The assumptions were confirmed, including the unconfirmed planets from Earth observations: the star is a red dwarf, spectral type M3V, with approximately 30 percent of the mass of Sol. As presumed, the system has five large planets - smallest is approximately twice the mass of Earth, largest is 16 times the mass of Earth. All planets have very close orbits to the star and are tidally locked. All are designated My Way 1 through 5, with increasing distance from the star. None are habitable, due to extreme gravity. The best use we have for them are as shields from solar wind and radiation due to their size and strong magnetic fields. Human habitation is confined mostly to converted ships and artificial habitats, as well as the hundreds of small bases in the massive comet and asteroid debris belt which we use for resource mining of everything from oxygen and water to every single element we need.

Who arrived? The original plan, back on Earth well advertised as “The Effort” was to find planets for terraforming and human expansion as the solar system was getting overcrowded. Of the six waves of ships that were planned, only the first three arrived. List of arriving ships is below, including the official designations of the ships as well as their informal names:

Wave 1 - the blind men

- Generation Ship 1 (GS1) - Ray Charles
- Generation Ship 2 (GS2) - Stevie Wonder

Wave 2 - the legends

- Generation Ship 3 (GS3) - Lewis Armstrong
- Generation Ship 4 (GS4) - Nina Simone
- Generation Ship 5 (GS5) - Antonio Jobim

Wave 3 - the rat pack

- Generation Ship 6 (GS6) - Frank Sinatra
- Generation Ship 7 (GS7) - Peter Lawford
- Generation Ship 8 (GS8) - Dean Martin
- Generation Ship 9 (GS9) - Sammy Davis

We have no information of what happened to the rest of the ships. Signals from Earth that were planned to initiate as we arrive in the system have never arrived. We have a continuous laser beam signaling status towards the solar system but we haven’t received any acknowledgement.

The waves launched with 20 Earth Years (EY) between each other. The first wave travelled at 10% C and took 199 years to travel the distance. The advances in propulsion and technology learned from the telemetry of the previous waves enabled optimized engines and higher acceleration for the same fuel expenditure for the next wave. Hence the second wave achieved 12% C and took 165 years to travel the distance. The third wave achieved 14% C and took 141 years to travel the distance. Wave 3 and 2 overtook wave 1 in transit.

- Wave 3 arrived 181 years after the Launch of the first wave
- Wave 2 arrived 186 years after the Launch of the first wave
- Wave 1 arrived 199 years after the Launch of the first wave

During launch of the third wave, the ship GS6 - Frank Sinatra was lost during the exit of the Solar system. An extremely unlikely event - the GS Frank Sinatra hit an asteroid in the Oort cloud at nearly 14% C and was instantly destroyed. In the honor of that loss, the arriving ships of the third wave renamed this system “My Way”.

The casualties of the transit for Wave 1 were around 30% of the living humans in hibernation and around 10% of genetic materials/embryos died or became infertile during transit. The second and third wave suffered around 10% loss in living humans and genetic material, benefiting from more advanced hibernation tech.

Current government and organization within My Way: There is no central government. The GS ships are distributed to multiple orbits to provide support of all colonists and habitats, and to maintain sphere of police and military influence since the ships keep the only official armed shuttle and missile complements as well as colonists with law enforcement expertise. The current government structure is more akin to city states with captains of the GS ships being local presidents than central government. The food, health, communication and other services are provided by private groups and habitats (listed in the appendix) and only supplemented by the GS ships.

Please note that GS8 is currently mothballed and kept in interstellar flight capability for a possible mission back to Earth.

The current status of the colony is that there are approximately 900,000 alive humans in the system, and we have been here for 79 EY. The colony is able to survive and you will be able to support that survival and even establish your own business based on your expertise.
