It's been a while by any standard. Took me 7 EY to gather my thoughts and another 3 EY to understand what really happened to you.

<details><summary>I give up! Let me see the solution!</summary>

The ship has a build feature designed to assist the human race in case of extreme peril. Examples of extreme peril include malfunction of colonist section, disease, malfunction of at most 50 percent of compute resources on the ship, encounter with adverse natural situation (asteroid field, dust cloud or similar which can destroy or significantly damage the ship) or encounter with a hostile/alien element. If you deem that the survival of the mission and colonists is at extreme risk the ship has a modular subsection that can function as an independent emergency spaceship. That subsection has separate engines, will take a set of ten thousand colonists and several cargo submodules upon separation. The cargo, colonist cryo modules and fuel modules are structured in a way that the emergency spaceship can separate cleanly from the rest of the ship without major damage to the rest of the modules. The navigation computers of the emergency subsection are programmed with a secondary destination system approximately 70 light years from Earth, at a speed of maximum 7%C.

Be mindful! If you decide that the situation is dire and execute the submodule separation you will be literally sending the emergency spaceship on a thousand year trip into the unknown as well as abandoning the rest of the crew on the major modules of the ship.

To activate separation you need to enter the command codes into the three emergency terminals located in the habitation, aft hibernation and front electronic storage modules, with confirmation codes from the Xenobiology and Biomedical expert on at least two of the same terminals.
