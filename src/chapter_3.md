This is my the first log entry after emerging from hibernation. I am one of the crew members tasked with being awake during the 75 days of deceleration. A completely redundant assignment since no human can react fast enough to make any difference in steering an interstellar spaceship. The engines fired as planned, and this massive cylinder is breaking at one half Gee. Since I am not useful, I’ll indulge in a stupidly long log entry. Might as well, once we reach our destination I’ll only have time for a couple of sentences a day.

When I woke up I was thirsty. So thirsty!

I heard faint alert sounds around me but couldn’t do anything about that. I had no control of my body and my eyes seemed to be glued together. Intellectually I knew that I was waking from long term hibernation, a slumber that lasted for nearly two hundred Earth Years. I survived it, which is a miracle in itself.

The hibernation module disconnected its mechanisms from me and allowed me to regain control over my body. First the autonomic nervous system was allowed to take over, confirmed with a trickle of urine around my thigh. Then the eyes, and the motor functions of my head. I looked directly toward another row of identical modules, with a dark corridor going left and right (or up and down?). No gravity, SS Ray Charles hadn’t started the breaking maneuver. The hibernation chamber automation rudely reminded me that I have full control of my body by painfully sticking a large needle into my thigh and injecting me with a concoction of whatever vitamins and stimulants the biomed teams considered appropriate.

I floated out of the chamber and looked around. I was in a deep (high) canyon whose walls were hundreds of hibernation modules. Some modules indicated “Life Functions Lost”. Hence, the alert sounds. Some colonists weren’t as lucky as me. Or were they luckier?

No use trying to find the rest of the assigned maneuver observation crew. Their chambers will wake them up if they are alive or their alternates will be woken up. Naked and now cold, I floated off towards the brightly lit airlock to the human habitation module. Still, so very thirsty!

The human habitation module is a fairly cramped affair. A toroidal structure in the very middle of the length of our beloved SS Ray Charles, hidden below multiple layers of radiation shielding. Since this ship is over two kilometers long and has an approximate diameter of 500 meters you would think that the human habitation module is huge. Well it is, but it also contains everything that the 25 humans using this module would need for at least 1 year -- food, water, reserve oxygen, recycling and recirculation, computers, interfaces, medical equipment, utility robots, even data banks. The rest of the massive payload of the SS Ray Charles is secured and unreachable.

The full complement of 25 crew members is awake and wasting air, much like myself. Seven are alternates, one is a second alternate. Inventory is still running but it looks like we have lost around 30% of the colonists. We still have around 70,000 alive colonists in hibernation. In the grand scheme of things that is actually fantastic news -- long term hibernation was never used for a period of 200 years.

We confirmed that our Sister ship, Generation Ship GS2 better known as SS Stevie Wonder is happily executing the same maneuver as we are and is reporting nominal status, with similar loss of human life.

The crew members with Astronomy expertise say we are already within the boundaries of the system, but they are using the heliopause distance of the Solar system. I won’t pick that fight, Ray Charles will reach parking orbit just beyond the farthest planet regardless of any debate about heliopause distance. We can see the planets and some planetoids on long range telescopes, and radar is starting to map the massive belt of asteroids and comets that is going to be our source of raw materials.

My work assignments for when Ray Charles achieves parking orbit just arrived. I am to plan and deploy a network of relay satellites that will help the probes transfer data and telemetry back to the Ray Charles. I guess I was an alternate for someone that died in transit. I have better things to do than typing useless rants into the log databanks. While the rest of the crew wakes up I can’t find much human help for this assignment. I’ve been looking at the prototype machine learning package that is bundled in the ship’s computer arrays. They call it a Supporting Intelligence and although currently as dumb as a rock looks very able to learn. Time to make a copy of the SI and start training it in satellite management.
